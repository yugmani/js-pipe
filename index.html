  <h1>JAVASCRIPT PIPE AND COMPOSE</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Can we make a only one function call instead of multiple function calls?
      This is called a nested function calls
    </li>
    <li>
      Nested function calling is a not a bad way but it way of looking not a
      nice and mostly we loss some readability of code.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        'pipe' is nothing but a simple function in javascript.That function
        accepts the any number of functions as arguments and reducing like one
        by one by solving each function and that solved function output makes
        input of the another function call inside reduce.This chaining process
        will continue untill the last function solve.
      </p>
      <h3>Breakdown of pipe definition:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pipe is a function that takes an argument with a spread operator
          variable. that means we can pass N number of functions as arguments
          for pipe
        </li>
        <li>
          That function returns a another function that function takes argument
          as our input value.Here we would know about one thing pipe function
          acts as a HigherOrderFunction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Returned function will process the each and every function one by one
          using Array.reduce Like one function result will be input of another
          function this process will continue untill all the functions are
          excuted.so that’s one of the reason we use spread operator argument in
          the pipe function
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>How does Array.reduce() work?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Array.Reduce will accept the two arguments first one is a function and
          second one is a parameter which acts as default value.That default
          value act’s as a first argument of function which we will provided as
          a first argument to Array.reduce
        </li>
        <li>
          Inside function each time running and initially first argument takes
          as a default value and second argument will be first value in the
          array then returned value from that function act’s as a first argument
          for that function this chaining process will be continue untill array
          will be reduced
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>What’s The Compose?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Compose is the mirror to the pipe concept</li>
        <li>
          Observe carefully in the pipe function it can resolve functions from
          left to right when we passing arguments to the pipe function
        </li>
        <li>
          In that Like Same way compose will resolve the Right to Left so when
          we passing arguments to the compose function
        </li>
        <li>
          “we will pass which function will execute the last that one first
          arugument to compose function”
        </li>
        <li>
          “The function which will execute the first that one last argument to
          comose function”
        </li>
        <li>
          like the way we pass reverse order of pipe function arguments for the
          compose function
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Why pipe functions named as pipe?</h3>
      <p>
        “The concept of pipe is simple it combines n functions. It’s a pipe
        flowing left-to-right, calling each function with the output of the last
        one. Let’s write a function that returns someone’s name”.
      </p>
